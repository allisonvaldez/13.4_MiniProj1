13.4 Mini Project 1

This is the Mini Project 1 for lesson 13.4. Currently it is not working. I am receiving the error: /bin/sh: cls: command not found. When I comment-out that line I only see the output: macbook-pro. Which is the name of my computer... The code seems to come broken and Springboard seems to be unaware...
