13.4 Mini Project 1

This is the Mini Project 1 for lesson 13.4. Currently it is not working as the lab states . I am receiving the error: 
/bin/sh: cls: command not found. When I comment-out that line I only see the output: macbook-pro. Which is the name of 
my computer... The code seems to come broken and Springboard seems to be unaware... When I press enter I receive a prompt
that the scan was complete but no open ports were found. When I press enter it scans, but the exception do not work or 
they are slow to trigger.
